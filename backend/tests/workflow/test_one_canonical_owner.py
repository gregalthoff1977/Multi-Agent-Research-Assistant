"""
One operation, one owner — proved by object identity (parity Phase 6).

`test_host_parity` asks whether a route *exists* on both hosts, and Phase 1 taught it to
compare declared response shapes. Neither can tell the difference between "both hosts call
the same function" and "both hosts have their own function that currently agrees". That
difference is the entire subject of this refactor: the `/runs` surface is shared and the
`/research` surface is two implementations, and from the outside on a good day they look
identical.

Identity is the check that cannot be satisfied by agreement. Two copies of a function are
two objects, however alike; one function referenced twice is one object. So for every
operation below, both hosts' routes must resolve to the same `code` object.

**This measures ownership, not behaviour.** A wrapper could carry the marker and then do
something else. What covers that is `tests/parity/`, which drives the operation on both
hosts and compares the result to a recorded contract. The two are complementary: this says
who owns the operation, the goldens say what it does.

The table is the registry. When Phase 6 finishes moving handlers into `app/handlers/`, the
owner named here becomes the handler and both hosts become wrappers; the assertion does not
change.
