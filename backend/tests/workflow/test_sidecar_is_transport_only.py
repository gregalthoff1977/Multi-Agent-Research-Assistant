"""
`desktop/sidecar.py` is a thin adapter, and a line count is how that stays true (plan
phase 11).

Phase 6 declined to physically move the run/session/project/corpus handlers into
`app/handlers/` — `test_one_canonical_owner` already proves single ownership by identity,
so the move would rename files without closing a gap (`internal/plans/13_
One_Runtime_Two_Hosts.md` §0.10). That decision means `sidecar.py` legitimately keeps code
no thin transport layer would: the desktop-only routes (`/desktop/keys/*`, `/local/start`,
`/local/stop`, the flat `/corpus/*` convenience routes), and the host implementations of
every port this plan built (`_DesktopCorpusLocator`, `get_checkpoint_deleter`,
`get_terminal_event_emitter`, `sidecar_run_config`). Revision 1's target of "~450 lines"
assumed the handler move would happen; it did not, so that number is not a ceiling this
file can honestly reach and is not used here.

What this file still guards: the file should never grow *without someone noticing*. Every
phase in this plan that delegated a route shrank `sidecar.py` — Phase 7 by ~700 lines
across the run, session, project and corpus surfaces combined. A ceiling that only ever
rises would let that trend reverse silently, one route at a time, the same way the
duplication this whole plan exists to remove first accumulated.

`CEILING` ratchets down as more delegates and is lowered in the same commit that shrinks
the file — never raised to make a growing file pass. Growing past it is not necessarily
wrong (a new desktop-only feature needs somewhere to live), but it must be a deliberate
edit to this number with a reason, not a side effect nobody reviewed.

#: letting SQLite raise a driver error during startup that names neither table nor column.
#: Raised from 2,900 deliberately rather than by trimming the guard — this is the same class
#: as the two entries below it: desktop-only code with no `app/api/v1/*` route to delegate to,
#: because `create_all` plus a column sync is how *this* host builds its schema and no server
#: route owns that. Was 2,876 at the Windows shell-watchdog fix (`shell_alive`/
#: `_win32_pid_alive`, plus the sidecar finally calling `configure_logging` — process
#: supervision and logging bootstrap for a process that is not itself an HTTP handler), and
#: 2,850 before that, itself down from 3,015 before plan phase 7 began delegating session
#: routes. Small headroom above the current count, not a target to grow into.
# A new versioned research-package JSON route needs a thin auth/DI wrapper on the
