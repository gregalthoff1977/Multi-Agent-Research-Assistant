"""
The migration chain is walkable in both directions, on a database with data in it.

`docs/architecture/05-data-model.md` has claimed for a long time that "every migration has a
real `downgrade()`, and the round-trip is exercised in CI". Neither half was true: nothing
anywhere ran a downgrade, and when one was finally run it failed — `0008_chat_threads`
dropped `ck_chat_messages_ck_chat_messages_one_parent`, a doubled prefix produced by passing
an already-rendered name back through the metadata naming convention. That constraint has
never existed in any database, so **every** downgrade past revision 0008 died there, on any
data, empty or not. V3 adds nine migrations on top of a chain nobody had ever reversed.

**Its own database, never the suite's.** These tests take the schema apart and put it back;
`conftest.migrated_database` brings the shared test database to head once per session and
every other test in the suite depends on it staying there. So this file creates and drops a
scratch database of its own, per test, and touches nothing else on the server.

**Two populated scenarios, because "reversible" is not one property.**

*Compatible* (`test_a_populated_database_survives_a_full_round_trip`) — a realistic row in
every table, all of it expressible in the historical schemas, goes down to base and back up.

*Incompatible* (`test_a_run_sourced_memory_chunk_refuses_the_0022_downgrade`) — project
memory indexed from a **run** cannot satisfy `0022`'s reinstated foreign key to `sessions`,
and the migration says so itself: "Reinstating the FK fails if any run from the current
pipeline has been indexed, which is correct: those rows reference `research_runs`, and the
constraint would be a lie." So `0022` is not irreversible; it is *conditionally* reversible,
and the condition is a real product state. What matters there is that the refusal is clean —
PostgreSQL's transactional DDL must leave the schema and every row exactly as they were,
because a half-applied downgrade is how a database becomes unrecoverable.
