"""
Claim-extraction parity (M0A).

`graph._verify_citation_fidelity` strips citation markers from claims their own evidence
does not back. `evals.harness.judge_citation_support` then measures how well that worked.
If the two disagree about *what a claim is*, the measurement stops measuring the guard —
the judge rules on sentences the pass never saw, or on fragments of them.

`graph.py` has carried a comment asserting the two "MUST mirror" each other since docs/12
M5. Nothing checked it, and the two implementations were separate copies of four regexes
plus a hand-inlined sentence splitter. These tests are that check.

They pin three things:

1. **Identity** — `evals.metrics` and `graph` use the *same objects* from
   `research_engine.claims`, so a copy-paste back into either file fails here.
2. **Agreement** — over a corpus of report shapes, the cited claims the graph acts on are
   exactly the cited claims the judge rules on.
3. **The deliberate divergences** — two scanning differences remain on purpose. Pinned so
   that they stay deliberate and a third one cannot appear unnoticed.
