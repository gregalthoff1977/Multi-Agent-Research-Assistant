"""Regression: citation fidelity is verified before a draft reaches the gate (docs/12 M5).

Two defects in one run (eval-2026-08-12) pinned these:

1. A cited claim the judge marked unsupported (postgres-vs-mysql at 0.5256 support)
   reached the user unchanged. The synthesizer writes from the executor's key_fact, which
   can drift past its verbatim snippet — and the eval judge rules on snippets. So the
   graph now checks every cited claim against the snippets of its own cited sources with
   the SAME ruling method the eval judge uses, and strips the markers from any claim that
   fails — never silently editing a claim into appearing uncited.

2. Eight of ten queries died with "planner: could not produce a valid task list" while
   the real cause was a 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED on the provider key. `with_structured_output`
   RAISES on provider errors, `_structured` swallowed the exception, and the planner read
   the None as an unparseable plan. Provider/API errors must surface with the provider's
   own message, and a quota exhaustion must not burn a pointless retry.
