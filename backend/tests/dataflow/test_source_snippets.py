"""
Every snippet from a source is retained (docs/12 M5, defect D3).

Found while investigating why the real-model citation-support rate sat at 0.41. The
synthesizer kept only the *first* snippet per URL, but one page routinely backs several
distinct facts and the same source is cited for ~8 different claims per report — so a
citation chip could display verbatim text that had nothing to do with the sentence it was
attached to, and the eval's judge was scoring that retention bug rather than the model's
citation quality.

This is the product's central promise: hover a citation, read the text that backs *this*
claim. These tests pin it.
