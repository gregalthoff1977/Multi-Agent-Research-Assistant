"""
The desktop sidecar (docs/12 M9, docs/13 §7).

A single-process local host for the whole product: the same API surface the frontend
already speaks (`/api/v1/*`), backed by SQLite and the in-process research engine —
no Docker, no Postgres, no Redis, no login. The Tauri shell spawns it, reads the
handshake line (port + token) from stdout, and points its WebView at it.

Security contract (docs/13 §7 — not optional):

- Binds `127.0.0.1` only, on an ephemeral port chosen by the OS.
- Every request must carry the per-launch bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer …`).
  A localhost port with no token is reachable by any process on the machine — and by
  any web page via DNS rebinding. The token middleware fails closed: no token, wrong
  token, or a path outside the API prefix → 401. Native `EventSource` cannot set
  headers, so the SSE endpoint also accepts `?access_token=…`; the WebView injects it.
- No auth endpoints exist here. `GET /auth/me` returns the single local user so the
  frontend's existing session boot works unchanged; there is no password anywhere.

What differs from the server host, and nothing else:

- Celery → `asyncio.create_task`; Redis pub/sub → an in-process per-session fan-out.
  Events are still persisted to `agent_logs`, so SSE replay after reconnect works the
  same way (Last-Event-ID honored).
- `memory_chunks` is excluded from `create_all` — its pgvector column is Postgres-only.
  Project memory (approved-report ingestion) is the one feature absent on desktop;
  the airgapped corpus (docs/12 M10) has its own SQLite store and local embeddings.
- PDF export answers 501 by design: the desktop renders PDF via the WebView's
  print-to-PDF (docs/13 §7), and WeasyPrint's GTK chain stays out of the bundle.

    constraint it was created with, unrebuilt, until this function (or a dedicated

# that 404'd" turned inside out. And because the switch was the *only* input to
# `RunConfig.corpus_mode` on this host, the `corpus_mode` a request set and the session row
# stored was never read: a run asked for as airgapped was recorded as airgapped and
# executed over the open web. `app/schemas/research.py` names that exact class.

    # The desktop's answer to `app/run_execution.py::execute_run`, which is server-only:
    # it takes a Redis lock, opens the server engine and checkpoints to Postgres, none of
    # which exist here. Everything *above* that function in `run_execution` is host-free and
    # is imported rather than restated — `persist_outcome` writes the domain rows and
    # `lifecycle_event` names the terminal event, so a desktop run and a server run cannot
    # record different things about the same outcome.
    #
    # Only the mechanism differs: an asyncio task instead of a Celery message, this host's
    # SQLite saver instead of the Postgres one, and the desktop's own `RunConfig` builder
    # instead of the server settings. Same shape as `_drive_session` above, which is the
    # long-standing precedent for exactly this substitution.

    #: Guards against two drivers on one run. Celery can redeliver a message, which is why
    #: the server takes a Redis lock; a single-process host cannot, but a user double-
    #: clicking Approve can still land two coroutines on one run, and the second would
    #: resume a graph the first is already advancing.

        The desktop build rendered no way to reach this and the sidecar served no route,
        so the product's central differentiator — an artifact a third party can check
        offline — was unreachable from the app it ships in. Same failure shape as the
        chat panel that 404'd for a whole release.

        Four things differ from the server, and nothing else should:

        * evidence and contradictions come from the SQLite checkpointer rather than the
          Postgres one — same `aget_state`, different saver;
        * there is no `crypto.decrypt` step, because this host has no BYOK column;
        * the report is read directly rather than through `_report_or_404`, which is a
          server module; the demo rule it encodes is reproduced here (see below);
        * `trace_available` is **True**. `bundle.py`'s docstring cites the desktop as the
          example of a host without durable logging, but `PersistingSink` writes an
          `agent_logs` row for every event exactly as the worker's sink does, so the
          trace is real and saying otherwise would understate the artifact.

        The report is deliberately NOT demo-stamped, matching the server: `report_hash` is
        checked against the `draft_hash` recorded at approval, so prose injected into the
        body would break the approval chain for a reason that has nothing to do with the
        bundle's integrity. The `demo` field carries that provenance instead and is covered
        by `bundle_hash`.

        uses for its corpus locator and checkpoint deleter.

        Delegating this used to raise "Redis pool not initialized": the server's route
        called `app.db.redis.publish_event` directly, with no seam for a host that has
        no Redis. `TerminalEventEmitter` is that seam — this host's implementation wraps
        `persist_and_publish`, the same durable-write-then-publish function every other
        event this host emits already goes through, so the desktop cancel path no longer
        has its own bespoke event construction to drift from the server's (it used to
        build `make_event("FAILED", message=...)`, putting the reason where the server's
        `data.reason` convention does not look for it).

        **Cancellation is cooperative-by-omission, and that is the honest word for it.**
        Nothing interrupts the running work: the sidecar's `asyncio.Task` and the server's
        Celery task both continue to their next checkpoint, spending tokens after the user
        has been told the run stopped. What issue #54 changed is that the decision now
        *sticks* — `cancelled_at` is durable and `_apply_outcome` refuses to move a
        cancelled session out of its terminal state, so the run can no longer come back to
        life minutes later and offer its report for approval.

        Preemption stays unbuilt on purpose rather than by neglect. Killing the task risks a
        half-written LangGraph checkpoint, and the sidecar could do it (it owns the Task)
        where the server would need a different mechanism — which is exactly the undeclared
        divergence AGENTS.md warns about. A cooperative check at node boundaries is the
        shape that would work identically on both hosts; until it exists both hosts behave
        the same way, and `docs/25` says so plainly.

    # is a real infrastructure difference and it stays.
    #
    # What was wrong is that the difference leaked into the client. The Corpus page and
    # the report preview call `/projects/{id}/corpus/...` — the server's shape — with no
    # `isDesktop` branch, so on desktop the document list, status panel, upload, delete
    # and preview all 404'd. Both hosts had a complete corpus implementation and they
    # never met (M1, `KNOWN_DESKTOP_GAPS`).
    #
    # So the per-project path is the **canonical product contract** and both hosts serve
    # it. Here it resolves to the one flat store, which is exactly the "same contract,
    # different internals" split the parity harness is meant to protect. Adding a branch
    # to the frontend instead would have taught it about a storage decision it has no
    # business knowing.
    #
    # `resolve_project` (the server's, case-insensitive on the default project — see
    # projects.py) still runs and still 404s on an unknown project, matching the server's
    # authorization boundary — the project id is not *used* to pick a store, but
    # answering for a project that does not exist would be a different contract.

    # All five routes below delegate. `_corpus()`'s not-ready-yet 503 and the flat routes'
    # own store access above are unaffected — `_DesktopCorpusLocator` calls `_corpus()`
