Provider-pluggable LLM factory (docs/architecture/04-agent-architecture.md §7, docs/13 §6).

Roles are resolved from "provider:model" config strings so BYOK users can point
any role at any configured provider. Prices and per-model capabilities come from
`research_engine.catalog`; a routed model with no price fails fast at startup.

LLM_MODE=fake returns deterministic scripted models (no keys, no network).
