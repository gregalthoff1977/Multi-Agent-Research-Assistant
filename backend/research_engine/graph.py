"""
The research agent pipeline as a real compiled LangGraph StateGraph
(docs/architecture/04-agent-architecture.md). No hand-rolled loop, no fail-open behavior.

    planner → executor(all pending tasks, in parallel) → critic(all, in parallel) ─┐
                     ▲                       (any task failed, retries remain)     │
                     └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    (every task passed or out of retries) → contradiction_detector → synthesizer → hitl_gate
    hitl_gate --interrupt--> (approve) finalizer / (reject) synthesizer
    budget/time breach anywhere → failer

Research runs in *rounds* rather than per-task pipelines (docs/12 M7): a round researches
every pending task concurrently, grades them all, and the failures retry together in the
next round. A per-task pipeline would let a fast task start its retry while a slow one is
still on its first pass, but it would also move the retry loop out of the graph and into
hand-rolled orchestration. Rounds are capped at `max_critic_loops`, so the barrier costs
little and the retry path stays a conditional edge in the compiled graph.

    snippet renders clean, resolves to a real URL, and shows a quotation in quote marks
    that was never written — strictly worse, and precisely the failure this product exists
    to prevent.

    Not hypothetical. On 2026-08-16 a real-model run attributed "For overlap heatmaps
    prefer Morisita-Horn (abundance-weighted, depth-robust) over Jaccard (presence/absence,
    depth-biased), and normalize depth first" to PMC3543521. That paper contains no such
    sentence, and the citation rendered clean because nothing checked it.

    Blanking rather than dropping the chunk: `key_fact` and the URL may still be sound, and
    `_number_sources` already skips empty snippets, so the citation loses its quote instead
    of displaying an invented one. Returns the chunks that failed, for logging.

    Repair, not laundering: a model that quotes a page faithfully but labels it with the
    wrong URL has made a citation error, and blanking a genuine quotation over it throws
    away real evidence. So a snippet that is verbatim in exactly ONE other fetched source
    is re-pointed at that source — and the URL the model claimed is kept on the chunk under
    `snippet_reattributed`, because a repair a reader cannot see is a silent rewrite of what
    the model said. Two conditions keep this from becoming a guess:

    - **exactly one** match, or the chunk is blanked like any other unverifiable quote. A
      sentence appearing in several fetched pages has no determinable source, and taking
      whichever the dict yielded first would attribute the same run differently on a rerun.
    - the URL written back is the one the tool reported, scheme intact — see
      `record_tool_output` on why `seen` is keyed that way.

    `grades`, when supplied, is where this function's verdict actually gets recorded for a
    reader: a chunk that verifies is stamped `attestation_grade` (`FETCHED_BODY` or
    `SEARCH_SNIPPET`), so `record_evidence` can persist `ATTESTED`/`attested_against`
    instead of the `UNCHECKED` it would otherwise write for a citation this function just
    finished checking. Optional so every existing caller — including this module's own
    tests — keeps working unchanged; the production call site always passes it.

    The executor's tool loop *invites* `submit_evidence`; nothing obliges a model to
    accept. Run `96a16137` searched and fetched successfully and then simply kept
    searching until it ran out of rounds — evidence `[]`, twice, and a failed run whose
    stated reason was to go check a search provider that had answered every query. A model
    declining to call one tool must not be able to discard text the engine already holds.

    Two constraints make this an extraction step rather than a second opinion:

    - it is handed **only** `seen_text`, so there is no route by which model memory can
      become a citation, and
    - `verify_evidence_snippets` still rules on what comes back, exactly as it does for a
      voluntary submission.

    **Two mechanisms, because one is not reliable on a router alias.** `custom:auto/*`
    resolves per call — a single task was served by three different models in one observed
    run — and a named `tool_choice` that most honour, some silently ignore, returning an
    assistant message with no tool call. So a refusal is retried as structured output,
    which is a differently shaped request rather than the same one twice.

# ── Citation-fidelity verification (docs/12 M5) ──────────────────────────────────
#
# The eval judge rules on a claim against the snippets of its cited sources — and the
# baseline run measured the synthesizer shipping claims its own snippets do not back
# (postgres-vs-mysql at 0.5256). The drift enters through the executor's key_fact, which
# the synthesizer follows past the verbatim snippet. So before a draft reaches the human
# gate, every cited claim gets the SAME ruling here: supported → untouched; not supported
# → its markers are stripped and the claim is flagged, because a citation the evidence
# does not back is worse than an admitted gap.

# Must END with a sentence terminator: the eval judge splits sentences on [.!?] +
# whitespace, and a note without one gets merged into the FOLLOWING sentence — measured
# as a supported claim ruled NO because it carried the previous claim's note (run #3).
_VERIFIED_NOTE = " *(citation could not be verified)*."
# The claim split MUST mirror the eval judge's `claims.split_sentences`/`claim_lines`
# exactly (lookahead on the next sentence's opener + abbreviation rejoin): this pass is
# measured by that judge, so it must rule on the same claims, not fragments of them.
#
# It now does so by *importing the same objects* rather than restating the patterns —
# four regexes were duplicated here and in `evals.metrics`, with a comment asserting they
# matched and nothing checking it. `tests/test_claim_extraction_parity.py` pins both the
# identity of these primitives and the sentence-for-sentence agreement of the two scans.

# second Ollama eval. The claim split still mirrors the judge (separate sentences), and
# the verify pass strips such markers deterministically.

#: because widening the shared pattern would change what the eval judge counts as a claim,
#: which is a metrics-definition change and needs a `METRICS_VERSION` bump to be honest.
#: `tests/test_claim_extraction_parity.py` pins the divergence so it stays deliberate.
#:
#: The two branches are not interchangeable, and collapsing them to one optional `#`
#: (`#{0,6}`) is what issue #48 was: with the marker optional the pattern also matched
#: ordinary prose that merely *starts* with the word — "Sources of error were considered
#: [1]." — so the scan broke there and every remaining claim went unchecked. Unchecked
#: means its citation markers are never stripped, so the report renders *more* verified
#: than it is, which is the one failure class this project refuses outright. The heading
#: branch therefore stays open-ended (so `## Sources and References` still ends the body,
#: exactly as it does for the judge), while the bare-label branch must consume the whole
#: line — a label is all a label line contains.
