"""
Claim and citation extraction — the canonical implementation (docs/08 §5, docs/12 M5).

Three callers need to agree on *what a claim is* and *what counts as a citation*, because
they measure and act on the same sentences:

- `graph._verify_citation_fidelity` strips markers from claims their evidence does not back
- `evals.metrics` / `evals.harness` judge those same claims and publish a support rate
- `bundle.assemble` records them in the artifact a third party verifies

Two implementations of one definition is how the number a benchmark publishes and the
claims the pipeline acted on drift apart. This module is the single definition.

**It lives in the engine, not in `evals/`.** `research_engine/` must run inside a desktop
app with no eval harness installed, and `bundle.py` needs claim extraction — so the import
used to run engine → evals, which made the "standalone" engine package un-shippable
without `evals/` and contradicted `graph.py`'s own docstring. The dependency now points
the other way: `evals.metrics` re-exports from here. Nothing in this module imports
anything but `re`, which is what keeps `verify_bundle` runnable on a bare machine.

Everything here is pure and stdlib-only. Eval-specific aggregation (`METRICS_VERSION`,
`report_metrics`, `citation_stats`) stays in `evals.metrics`, because those are properties
of a measurement run rather than of a claim.
