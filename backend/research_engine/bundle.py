"""
Research bundle: the auditable export format (docs/12 M12).

"SBOM for research" — a self-contained JSON artifact that carries the report, every
claim, every evidence snippet with a content hash, the source list, contradictions,
model routing, costs, the full approval chain, and the agent trace. A standalone
verifier (verify_bundle.py) can check the whole thing offline with no AI and no network.

This module is the pure assembler: no DB, no ORM, no host. Both the API server and
the desktop sidecar produce bundles through it. Claim extraction comes from
`research_engine.claims` — the same definition the graph's citation-fidelity pass and the
eval judge use. It used to come from `evals.metrics`, which meant a desktop build could
not ship the engine without also shipping the eval harness.

Design decisions (docs/reference/15-bundle-format.md):

- **Content hashes are SHA-256 of the snippet text, not the source page.** The live
  page is non-reproducible (it changes); the snippet is exactly what the executor
  extracted and the citation-support judge ruled on. The hash proves it wasn't tampered
  with after research time.

- **Snippet is the complete stored evidence text**, not a display truncation. The
  executor caps it at 500 chars (EvidenceChunk.snippet max_length=500); that IS the
  full evidence.

- **bundle_hash covers ALL fields** (including trace and trace_available) except itself.
  Stripping the trace from a bundle that had one breaks the hash — correct. An absent
  trace (trace_available=false) is the truthful state and the hash covers that truth.

- **trace_available distinguishes three states** that would otherwise all be `trace: []`:
  host had logs and they're present, host had logs but nothing fired (edge), host does
  not support durable logging. Both shipped hosts are in the first state: the desktop
  sidecar's `PersistingSink` writes an `agent_logs` row per event exactly as the server
  worker's sink does, so it reports `trace_available=True` and a populated trace. This
  line named the sidecar as the no-durable-logging example until M0C, when adding its
  bundle route made the claim testable and it turned out to be false.
