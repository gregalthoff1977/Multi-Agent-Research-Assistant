"""
Run-scoped engine configuration (docs/13 §4, docs/12 M6 step 1).

The agent package must not read `app.config` or the process environment. It is being
extracted into a standalone `research_engine` package that has to run inside a desktop
app with no Postgres, no Redis, and no `.env` file — see
docs/architecture/13-local-and-self-hosted.md §2 for the measured coupling this removes.

Everything the graph, the model factory, the retrievers, and the tools used to read
from `settings` now arrives as a `RunConfig`.

Two levels of installation, mirroring the emitter indirection in `events.py`:

- `set_process_default(cfg)` — one baseline per process, installed by the host
  (`app.runtime.install_process_default` for the API/worker/eval processes; the
  desktop build will install one built from local config + OS keychain).
- `set_run_config(cfg)` — a `ContextVar` override scoped to one run, so concurrent
  runs in the same worker process can carry different model routing or budgets
  (needed by docs/12 M8's per-session model picker).

A `ContextVar` is used rather than threading config through `AgentState` because
tools are invoked by LangGraph without access to state, and `retrievers.search()`
is called from inside a tool — so state-threading cannot reach the retriever chain.
This matches the two existing precedents in this package (`events._emitter` and
`llm_factory._user_keys`).

`get_run_config()` resolves override → process default → module defaults. The module
defaults deliberately mirror `app/config.py`'s own field defaults exactly, so a host
that forgets to install one degrades to today's out-of-the-box behaviour rather than
to something subtly different. `tests/test_engine_boundary.py` pins that equivalence.
