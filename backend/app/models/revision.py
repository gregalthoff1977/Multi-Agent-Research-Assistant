"""
Report versions and the claim graph.

`revisions` has **zero mutable columns**. `state` and `superseded_by_id` were
removed once both were shown to derive from reviews, run status and version position —
`state` had been mixing generation lifecycle, review decision, approval and supersession in
one field. A table with no mutable columns cannot drift from facts it does not hold.

`claim_evidence_links` is where the claim graph becomes a graph, and it is **authoritative**:
the `[n]` markers in report prose are a rendering of this table, not the other way round
That inversion is the single most important difference from the session path, where the markers
*were* the data.
