"""
The research lifecycle — the persistence side of a run, host-free.

The research *engine* is unchanged: `research_engine.graph` plans, executes, criticises and
synthesizes exactly as it does today, and `RunOutcome` is still the plain-data handoff. What
changes is where a host writes that outcome. This module is the destination:

    question → ResearchRun → ResearchPlan → Sources + Evidence → Revision
             → Claims → ClaimEvidenceLinks → Contradictions → Review → Artifact → Bundle

**Host-agnostic on purpose.** No FastAPI, no auth, no Redis, no crypto. The server router and
the desktop sidecar both call these functions, so the lifecycle has one home rather than the
two that this repository keeps rediscovering (AGENTS.md, "two hosts, one contract").

Four rules, and this module is where each becomes behaviour rather than documentation:

* **Retrieved is not cited.** A `Source` gets a `citation_index` only if the synthesizer
  numbered it. Never generated (I6).
* **An item is attested only to what the graph actually verified.** The snippet check in
  `research_engine.graph.verify_evidence_snippets` runs per item and records its verdict on
  the chunk (`attestation_grade`, `snippet_unverified`); `record_evidence` below reads that
  verdict rather than asserting one. An item the check never reached — fake-mode runs, or a
  chunk with no snippet to check — lands `UNCHECKED`, honestly (I…§14).
* **A contradiction is a conflict between two attributed quotations.** `DETECTED` needs both
  source anchors; an evidence anchor is set only on an exact, unique quotation match (I7, I8).
* **Only an APPROVED REPORT review authorizes an artifact**, and the check goes through
  `app.authorization` rather than being re-derived here (I3).

Rework appends. `record_revision` allocates the next `version`, so revision 1 is never
overwritten and `Review.sequence` keeps the decision order that produced it.
