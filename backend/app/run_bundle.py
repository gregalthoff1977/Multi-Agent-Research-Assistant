"""
Assembling the verifiable artifact from the research domain tables.

One home: `app.run_lifecycle.create_artifact` freezes this into a `ResearchArtifact`.
`research_engine.bundle` is the schema and `research_engine.verify_bundle` is the checker,
both untouched — so an artifact this produces verifies with the same standalone script a
reader can run without the product.

Two refusals are load-bearing:

* **A run whose evidence was never read produces no bundle.** `research_runs.evidence_outcome`
  says whether the graph's evidence was actually recovered from its checkpoint. `READ` means
  the `evidence` rows *are* the record, so zero of them is a measured zero. Either failure
  state means the count is unknown, and a bundle asserting zero evidence there would number
  every `[n]` against nothing and claim a quality nobody observed.
* **A plan approval never serializes as `"approved"`.** `verify_bundle` treats that string
  as report authorization and no database constraint reaches a JSON file, so the guard has
  to be here.
