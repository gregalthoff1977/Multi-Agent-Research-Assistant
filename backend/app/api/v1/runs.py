"""
The read and review surface for a research run.

**One aggregate GET, three actions.** The next milestone builds nine UI surfaces — Overview,
Research, Evidence, Claims, Sources, Contradictions, Review, Artifacts, History — and every
one of them needs a slice of the same run graph. Nine endpoints would mean nine round trips
for one page and nine places for the run-scoping predicate to be got wrong; one projection
means the authorization check happens once, in one place.

The shapes here are deliberately thin over the domain: no field is renamed, nothing is
flattened, and the three-valued vocabularies (`provenance_state`, `detection_state`,
`verification_state`) travel as they are stored. A UI that wants to render "⚠ unverified"
must be able to tell `UNCHECKED` from `UNATTESTED`, and collapsing them here to save a few
bytes would put the product's central claim behind a translation layer.

**`citation_index` is nullable and that is load-bearing.** A source with no index was
retrieved and never cited. The UI must not number it.

Actions are the two gates and the artifact. `POST /plan-review` and `POST /report-review` go
through `app.run_lifecycle`, which goes through `app.authorization` — so the rule that only an
approved report review authorizes an artifact is not restated here.

#: Events after which *replay* stops — only the true terminals, deliberately NOT the gates.
#:
#: The distinction matters and this route originally missed it. `_TERMINAL_EVENTS` is the right
#: rule for the live tail: a graph suspended at an interrupt publishes nothing more, so
#: holding the socket open waits on no one. Applying it to the backlog is a different
#: statement — "stop reading history at the first gate" — and it is wrong. A client that
#: reconnects without a `Last-Event-ID` (a fresh EventSource, which is what a status
#: change creates) replays from id 0, hits the `PLAN_READY` row left over from the design
#: gate, and returns: everything the run did *after* the gate is never delivered, and the
#: live tail is never reached either. The session stream stops replay on
#: `("COMPLETED", "FAILED")` only, for exactly this reason; this route copied the tail's list into
#: both places.
_REPLAY_STOP_EVENTS = ("COMPLETED", "FAILED")

#: Run states in which nothing further will be published until a human acts, so the stream
#: closes after replaying the backlog instead of tailing.
#:
#: This is the check that `_TERMINAL_EVENTS` used to perform accidentally, by stopping the
#: *replay* at a gate. Doing it on the run's current status instead separates the two
#: questions properly: "has history moved past a gate" (it may have, and the client needs
#: what came after) versus "is the run sitting at one right now" (then there is nobody to
#: wait for). Without this, removing the gates from the replay rule would leave a client
#: reconnecting to a gate-parked run holding a socket nothing will ever write to.
