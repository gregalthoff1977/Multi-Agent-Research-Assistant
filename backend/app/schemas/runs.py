"""
Request bodies for the run routes.

**Why these live in `app/schemas/` rather than beside the routes.** The run surface has two
hosts — `app/api/v1/runs.py` on the server and `desktop/sidecar.py` on the desktop — and
the desktop host must accept *exactly* the same bodies, so the models are imported rather
than restated (AGENTS.md, "two hosts, one contract").

They used to be imported straight from the server route module, which made the contract
single-homed but reached `app.db.base` → `app.config` on the way, and the desktop host has
no `DATABASE_URL` or `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to build `Settings` with. The packaged sidecar died
at import (#50). Schemas are pure pydantic and depend on nothing host-specific, so this is
where they belong: one home, importable by both hosts, no configuration required.

Nothing in this module may import `app.config`, `app.db`, or anything reaching them.
`tests/test_sidecar_startup.py` fails if that changes.
