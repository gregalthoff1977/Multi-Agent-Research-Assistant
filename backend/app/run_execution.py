"""
Execution wiring: the research engine, persisted into the research domain.

This is an **adapter**, not a second pipeline. `research_engine.runner.run` and `.resume` are
called exactly as `app/workers/pipeline_runner.py` calls them, with the same ports, the same
`RunConfig`, the same LangGraph topology and the same checkpointer. Nothing in
`research_engine/` learns the domain exists — the dependency points one way, from here into the
engine.

    POST /runs ──► ResearchRun (PENDING)
                       │
                       ├─ Celery: run_research_pipeline
                       │    ├─ resolve routing + BYOK + RunConfig   (shared)
                       │    ├─ runner.run(...)                      (unchanged engine)
                       │    ├─ RunOutcome  +  final checkpoint state
                       │    └─ persist_outcome() ──► run_lifecycle ──► run rows

**Two sources, because the engine has two outputs.** `RunOutcome` carries the report, the
numbered source list, cost and tokens. Evidence and contradictions live in the LangGraph
checkpoint and always have — the session bundle route reads them the same way. So the adapter
reads the final state once, through the tri-state reader, and persists it transactionally.
After that the `evidence` table is authoritative and the checkpoint is execution history.

**The tri-state matters here too.** A run whose checkpoint cannot be read has not gathered
zero evidence; it has an unknown amount. `persist_outcome` records which of the three it was
and refuses to write a revision claiming citations it cannot resolve.

`persist_outcome` is deliberately the seam: pure over (db, run, outcome, state), with no
Celery, no Redis and no HTTP, so the integration test can drive the real engine and then call
it directly.
